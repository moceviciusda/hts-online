# HTS-Online

A work-in-progress online version of a tabletop game "Here to Slay" by Unstable Games built using Phaser 3, Express, and Socket.io.

This project is a multiplayer game I decided to develop in order to learn javaScript. Phaser 3 is used for the game client, Express for the server, and Socket.io for real-time communication.
The game functions with 2-4 clients. Number of players is set in server.js file.
